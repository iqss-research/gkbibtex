	Abstract = {Political scientists and economists have exhaustively examined the nexus
		between economic inequality and political conflict (EI-PC nexus) in aggregated
		civil wars. This article revisits the nexus and its related theories, empirically
		and parsimoniously testing the effects of inequality on disaggregated intrastate
		conflicts. The results buttress the notion that traditionally deprived
		identity groups are more likely to engage in conflict under more economically
		equal conditions, while class or revolutionary wars fall under the conditions
		of greater economic inequality and war. Of the three types of conflicts
		tested - ethnic conflicts, revolutions, and genocides - economic inequality
		seems to have the most ambiguous bearing on genocides. Support follows
		for recent findings that political and social equalities are of greater
		importance in mitigating ethnic violence and that greed factors might exacerbate
		violence in all civil conflicts, including genocides. The theoretical argument
		proposes that the context within which intrastate violence takes place
		affects the requisite level of relative resources needed for the escalation
		of violence between groups. The results have policy implications for ethnically
		divided states that are in the process of equalizing their income differential,
		but neglect the substantial inclusion of all groups within the political
		process and the distribution of public goods. The social contracts between
		the governors and the governed then require careful crafting for a peaceful
		coexistence of diverse identity groups.},

	Abstract = {The demography of armed conflict is an emerging field among demographers
		and peace researchers alike. The articles in this special issue treat demography
		as both a cause and a consequence of armed conflict, and they carry important
		policy implications. A study of German-allied countries during World War
		II addresses the role of refugees and territorial loss in paving the way
		for genocide. Other articles focusing on the demographic causes of conflict
		discuss highly contentious issues of whether economic and social inequality,
		high population pressure on natural resources, and youth bulges and limited
		migration opportunities can lead to different forms of armed conflict and
		state failure. The articles on demographic responses to armed conflict
		analyze the destructiveness of pre-industrial warfare, differences in short-
		and long-term mortality trends after armed conflict, and migratory responses
		in war. Another set of articles on demographic responses to war is published
		simultaneously in the European Journal of Population.},

	Abstract = {This research investigates the effect of armed conflict on adult mortality
		across countries and over time. Theoretical mechanisms are specified for
		how military violence influences adult mortality, both immediately and
		over time after conflict. The effects of aggregate conflict, interstate
		and intrastate conflicts, and conflict severity are explored. The Heckman
		selection model is applied to account for the conflict-induced missing
		data problem. A pooled analysis across 84 countries for the period from
		1961 to 1998 provides broad empirical support for the proposed theoretical
		expectations across both genders. This study confirms the importance of
		both the immediate and the lingering effect of military conflict on the
		mortality of the working-age population. The immediate effect of civil
		conflict is much stronger than that of the interstate conflict, while the
		reverse applies to the lingering effect. Both the immediate and the lingering
		effects of severe conflict are much stronger than those of minor conflict.
		While men tend to suffer higher mortality immediately from intrastate conflict
		and severe conflict, women in the long run experience as much mortality
		owing to the lingering effects of these conflicts. The mortality data show
		a strong data selection bias caused by military conflict. The research
		findings highlight the imperative for negotiating peace. Preventing a contest
		from escalating into a severe conflict can produce noticeable gains in
		saved human lives.},

@article{Ware05,
	Abstract = {This article explores the relationships between demography and internal
		conflict in the Pacific Island countries, focusing on the three subregions
		Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia. These countries confront distinctive
		challenges and opportunities because of their unique cultures and non-militarized
		status, combined with very small size and remote locations. The use of
		the MIRAB model of island economies based on migration, remittances, aid
		and bureaucracy is extended to examine its impact on social cohesion and
		the avoidance of internal conflict. For Polynesia, MIRAB is found to be
		a sustainable development strategy. Continuous emigration from Polynesia
		serves to reduce population pressure and communal tensions. Further, remittance
		income supports the Polynesian economies, and this also reduces the potential
		for conflict. For Micronesia, except Kiribati and Nauru, migration access
		to the USA is assured. In contrast, for the Melanesian countries, there
		is minimal emigration, rapid population growth and considerable intercommunal
		tension, which has resulted in several coups and one 'failed state'. Demographic
		pressure created by rapid population growth results in a lack of employment
		opportunities for youths (who provide the majority of participators in
		civil unrest and conflicts) rather than in direct pressure on land and
		other natural resources.},
